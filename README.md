# Crowdfunding_ETL
Utilized 13.1-Project-2-ETL-Solved.ipynb and 13.2-Project-2-ETL-Solved.ipynb for suggestions.
For 'Use a list comprehension to add "cat" to each category_id.'
Started with '# scat_ids = []
                    for y in subcategory_ids : 
                    scat_ids = ["subcat" + str(subcategory_ids)]'
Then played with different combinations until finally found 'scat_ids = [('subcat' + str(x)) for x in subcategory_ids]'
Needed help with converting two lists to Pandas DataFrame found simple answer on Geeks for Geeks site: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-pandas-dataframe-from-lists/

# Problems
Create the contacts DF. I could not iterrate through the first cell of Option 1. Trying Option 2. Rather than use all my time trying to figure it out, exporting as is to csv. Contacts.csv is not formatted.

PostgreSQL- couple of things here, 
1. Contacts.csv had obvious trouble due to formatting. Wouldn't create table.
2. Campaign.csv error occurred when trying to import file to table. Error was something along the lines of incorrect syntax for Goals column. Tried the following without success: int, long, single, numeric, bigint

Going to utilize office hours 11/30/2023 for any suggestions.
